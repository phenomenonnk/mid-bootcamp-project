1. we convert to measures the variables Waterfront, View, Condition.
we can also add Zipcode and Grade

2. price vs number of bedrooms: most of the observations that are expensive are
between 4 and 6 bedrooms, seems like normal distribution

price vs number of bathrooms: there are no specific elements and trends,
only that people tend to pay more for houses with bathrooms>2.
A polynomial trend line gives us r2 score 0,324

price vs condition: seems that the houses with condition 3,4,5 have signifficantly
higher prices from the houses with condition 1,2.
We can understand it better if we make 2 Clusters according to the prices

price vs floors: houses with 2 floors tend to be more expensive.
On the other hand houses with more than 3 floors tend to be cheaper.

price vs grade: we have an almost exponential increase for the two variables.
(the exponential r2 score for the trend line is 0,48, a little bit better is
the polynomial r2 score for k=3- 0,49)
We can notice that the amounts are proportional amounts,
so when the grade increases then the price increases as well and the opposite
when the grade decreases then the price decreases, as well.
Of course we can notice that people tend to pay more for houses with high grades.

price vs view: seems that there is no significant difference for the pair view-price,
we can check it with clustering by price.
Houses with view 4 tend to be more expensive

price vs waterfront: houses with waterfront tend to be a littl bit more expensive,
we can understand it better if instead of price we use average price,
we can notice higher density in high prices for houses with waterfront 

9. Most of the houses were built between 1960-1990 (7233 houses) and then 
between 1990-2015 (6648). In every category the prices of the houses decrease.
The rate of change differs per category, we notice that we have a small rate of chance in 
category A and high in categories C and D.
